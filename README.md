A jQuery plugin for creating responsive slideshows that work everywhere.

## Requirements


Jonathan, as we discussed the other day, we're getting to the point where we're ready for you to start working through some of the interactive gizmos on the site.

Brad, if you could start a running list of the JS interactions you need, that would be great. In the meantime, as we talked about, I think that the slideshow is an ideal place to start. Folding in the conversation over here https://basecamp.com/2109945/projects/1940747-tc-timberlake/messages/9255188-another-page-type-to it seems like the requirements are:

1. Responsive. The thing has to fit available width (making way for ads, small screens, etc).
2. Option to be either landscape or portrait (portrait for app screenshots).
3. Option to include arbitrary HTML
4. Option to unbundle to vertical "list" of slideshow panels.
5. Swipeable for touch devices.
6. Go fullscreen
